This project implements a few basic image processing algorithms and use a web based interface to display their effects

- Histogram Equalization  
- Piecewise Linear Contrast Stretching
- Manual Thresholding (per-channel and combined AND/OR logic)
- Otsuâ€™s Thresholding (Automatic segmentation)
- Convolutional Filtering (Custom kernel/filter application)
- Median Filtering
- Noise Addition (to images)
- Histogram Computation and Visualization
